    <li>1 ½ cups sifted cake flour</li>
    <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>5 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    <li>⅓ cup fresh orange juice</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon grated orange zest</li>
    <li>6 egg yolks</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>6 egg whites</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
    <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons fresh orange juice</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons grated orange zest</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
      Have ready an ungreased 10-inch tube pan with a removable bottom.
      Don't use a nonstick surface pan.
    </li>
    <li>
      Sift the flour, 1/2 cup sugar, baking powder and salt into a medium bowl.
      Form a well in the center and add the melted butter,
      1/3 cup orange juice, 1 teaspoon orange zest, egg yolks and vanilla.
      Beat for 1 to 2 minutes with an electric mixer.
    </li>
    <li>
      In a large glass or metal mixing bowl,
      beat egg whites and cream of tartar until foamy. Gradually add 1/2 cup sugar,
      continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the whites into the batter,
      then quickly fold in remaining whites until no streaks remain.
    </li>
    <li>
      Pour batter into the ungreased tube pan. Bake for 60 to 75 minutes,
      until the top springs back when lightly touched and a toothpick inserted comes out clean.
      Immediately invert and let the cake hang upside down until completely cool.
    </li>
    <li>
      Turn right side up and run a sharp knife around the edge to separate the cake from the pan.
      Remove sides. Run a knife around the center tube and under the cake;
      remove the pan bottom. Turn the cake right side up on a serving plate.
    </li>
    <li>
      To make the glaze: In a small bowl combine the confectioner's sugar,
      2 tablespoons orange juice, and 2 teaspoons orange zest.
      Spread over the top of the cake, letting some drip down the sides.
      Let stand at room temperature until glaze has set, about one hour.
    </li>
  </ol>
